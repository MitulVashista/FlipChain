# Tokenomics

FlipCoin (FP) is the native utility token of the FlipChain Loyalty Reward Platform. This document outlines the distribution and allocation of FlipCoins, as well as their utility within the platform.

## Distribution and Allocation

1. **Initial Purchase Reward:**
   - Customers will receive 100 FlipCoins on their first purchase from the FlipChain app.

2. **Purchase-Based Rewards:**
   - Customers will receive FlipCoins equal to 5% of the amount of the product on each purchase from the FlipChain app.

3. **Cumulative Milestone Rewards (Partner Brand Loyalty):**
   - Customers will receive additional FlipCoins based on the cumulative purchase amount from partner brands as follows:
    
        For Example:
     - Up to Rs. 10,000 cumulative purchase: 1% of product amount.
     - Rs. 10,001 - Rs. 30,000 cumulative purchase: 2% of product amount.
     - Rs. 30,001 - Rs. 80,000 cumulative purchase: 3% of product amount.

4. **Referral Rewards:**
   - Referrers will receive 100 FlipCoins when a new customer registers on the app using their referral code and makes their first purchase.

## Token Redemption

1. Customers can redeem FlipCoins for rewards or make partial payments (up to 50%) for item purchases within the FlipChain app.

2. Redeemed FlipCoins will be transferred to the brand offering the rewards or the item. For partial payments, the remaining payment can be made through other means.

3. Partner brands can issue rewards like discount vouchers that customers can obtain by redeeming FlipCoins.

## Token Purchase by Brands

1. Brands can buy FlipCoins from Flipkart at a rate of Rs. 0.1 per FlipCoin. This allows brands to acquire FlipCoins for rewarding loyal customers or for customer acquisition.

2. The brands can then distribute these FlipCoins to their customers as part of their loyalty programs or marketing campaigns.

## Token Utility

1. FlipCoins can be used to incentivize customer loyalty and engagement within the FlipChain app.

2. Customers can use FlipCoins to access rewards, discounts, and partial payments for products.
